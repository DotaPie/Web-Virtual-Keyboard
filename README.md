# Web Virtual Keyboard
- This is a tool to create virtual keyboard with ESP32-S3
- It can be access via web GUI and it can either input custom text, or use saved presets (which are also stored via web GUI)
- My use-case is to input long passwords without the need of typing them manually (where SSH is not possible)
- Works only with ENG keyboard on target
