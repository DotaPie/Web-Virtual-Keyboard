# Web Virtual Keyboard
- This is a tool to create virtual keyboard with ESP32-S3
- It can be accessed via web GUI and it can either input custom text, or use saved presets
- Preset are made from username and password and created/edited/deleted via web GUI
- My use-case is to input long usernames and passwords without the need of typing them manually (where SSH is not possible)
- Works only with ENG keyboard on target

**IMPORTANT**
- **Usernames and passwords are sent via plaintext, device is only secured by simple login (once per session)**
- **It is strongly recommended to use this device only on secured local networks**

# Hardware requirements
- ESP32-S3 with native USB
    - UART is optional, it is used to check ESP32-S3 IP in network and to read debug messages
- Other machine to access web GUI
- Target machine that will use this virtual keyboard

# Quick start
- Download and open platformio project in VS Code
- Change `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASS`, `MASTER_USER` and `MASTER_PASS`
    - If needed, change also other params
- Compile & Run
    - `html.cpp` and `html.h` are automatically generated during the build (from index.html)
- If connection is successful, IP of the device is printed in UART
- Plug native USB into the target machine (and UART to the other machine, if you want to check IP or logs)
- On other machine you can then access device by `http://DEVICE_IP` (default port is 80)
